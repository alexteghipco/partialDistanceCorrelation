# partialDistanceCorrelation

This matlab package provides several ways to perform partial distance correlation. The scripts in the main directory (mainly pdc.m) perform *partial* bias corrected distance correlation between two variables of interest and any number of variables that the relationship should be conditioned on. This is achieved by applying the recursive formula for partial correlation, but to bias corrected distance correlation coefficients. The recursive formula is implemented to handle any nth order partial correlation. P-values are generated in the same way as for bias corrected distance correlation (chi-square distribution). In addition, a linear partial correlation can be performed using the same recursive formula (i.e., for comparison). This can also be compared to matlab's internal partialcorr (also output by pdc.m), which shows very small (i.e., rounding, precision) deviations with higher order partial correlations (3+).

In ./permDCwithPartialCorrelation non-bias corrected partial distance correlation is computed and a permutation analysis is used to obtain p-values. partialdistcorr.m can compute the distance correlation after *linear* regression of control variables from two variables of interest. As such, this package does not consider nonlinear relationships between control variables and variables of interest.
